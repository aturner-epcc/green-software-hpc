<hr class="half-width"><p>In recent years, many economic actors have sought to reach different
climate goals by making various commitments to reducing carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>The terms “net zero”, “carbon neutral”, “carbon negative” and
“climate neutral” have been used interchangeably with the primary
objective to remove, reduce and prevent carbon emissions As interest in
these targets grows, it is essential to have a common understanding of
what they mean and how to achieve them through the strategies and
measurement procedures we have learnt.</p>

<h3 id="abatement-carbon-elimination">Abatement / Carbon Elimination<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#abatement-carbon-elimination"></a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" class="external-link">Science Based Targets
Initiative</a> refers to a mechanism called <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/legacy/2020/09/foundations-for-net-zero-executive-summary.pdf" class="external-link">abatement</a>,
which means eliminating sources of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated
with an organisation’s operations and <a href="https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/education/graduate-study/pgcerts/value-chain-defs" class="external-link">value
chain</a> so that they do not enter the atmosphere. The value chain
describes the full range of activities needed to create a product or
service, from conception to distribution.</p>
<p>Abatement is not enough on its own as there will always be some
emissions that cannot be eliminated due to technological or economic
constraints, but it must form the core of every emissions reduction
strategy.</p>
<p>To balance those residual emissions, we need to look at other
mechanisms such as offsets, compensations or neutralisations.</p>
<!-- Exercise to think about how an individual user may implement abatement -->
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="offsets">Offsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#offsets"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/what-is-a-carbon-offset/" class="external-link">Offsets</a>
are direct investments in emission-reduction projects through the
purchase of carbon credits on the voluntary carbon market (VCM). The VCM
is a decentralised market where private actors voluntarily buy and sell
carbon credits that represent certified removals or reductions of GHGs
from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>To offset emissions, you need to purchase the equivalent volume of
carbon credits to compensate for those emitted, where 1 carbon credit
corresponds to 1 tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed or reduced.</p>
<p>Various positive benefits can stem from these projects, from
ecosystem protection to empowering local communities. However, to ensure
these programs are implemented correctly and have the desired effect on
the environment and the aim to reach world net zero, there are global
standards that they must meet such as Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and
Gold Standard (GS).</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="hpc-ci-and-offsets">HPC-CI and Offsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hpc-ci-and-offsets"></a></h4>
<p>There are some limitations to carbon offsets and that is why they are
not considered in an HPC-CI metric. For example, imagine two projects,
both running on a HPC service that is 100% carbon offset and matched
100% by renewable energy. Project A has invested significant time and
resources into making sure it is using resources efficiently, whereas
project B uses resources very inefficiently. For the HPC-CI to be a
helpful metric, project A needs to score better than project B.</p>
<p>If the HPC-CI considered offsets, both projects would score 0. This
would not tell us anything about how efficiently they are using
resources. Although project B is emitting more carbon molecules into the
atmosphere per unit of output, since its score is 0 and the lowest score
is 0, why would it make further investments into improving its carbon
efficiency?</p>
<p>HPC services and users need to have plans for how to both eliminate
as well as neutralise emissions and the HPC-CI helps them to drive the
elimination of emissions due to their use of HPC systems. This makes the
HPC-CI a useful tool to help a research project or HPC service reach net
zero.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.abatable.com/blog/carbon-removal-vs-carbon-avoidance-projects" class="external-link">Compensations</a>
are actions that organisations or individuals can take to help society
avoid or reduce emissions. This is essentially investing in other
organisations’ abatement projects.</p>
<p>This includes actions such as:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Conservation</strong> - Credits are created based on carbon
not released through protecting old trees.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community Projects</strong> - These projects help
communities worldwide, mainly undeveloped ones, by introducing
sustainable living methods.</li>

<h3 id="neutralising-carbon-removal">Neutralising / Carbon Removal<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#neutralising-carbon-removal"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.abatable.com/blog/carbon-removal-vs-carbon-avoidance-projects" class="external-link">Neutralisations</a>
are actions that organisations or individuals take to remove carbon from
the atmosphere. Neutralisations refer to the removal and permanent
storage of atmospheric carbon to counterbalance the effect of releasing
CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. This includes actions such as:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Enhancing natural carbon sinks</strong> that remove
CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. For example, forest restoration,
since photosynthesis removes CO<sub>2</sub> naturally. Forest expansion
comes with challenges as it’s essential not to impact the dynamics of
farmland and food supply elsewhere. Modern farming methods can also
prolong the time carbon remains stored in soil.</li>
<li>
<strong>Direct air capture</strong> is the process of capturing
CO<sub>2</sub> from the air and storing it permanently, either
underground or in long-lived products like concrete.</li>
</ul><p>The effectiveness of these methods is typically measured based on
whether they can deliver carbon removal at the scale and speed
needed.</p>
<p>When it comes to carbon removal projects, durability is a critical
consideration. The durability of a project describes how long the carbon
dioxide will be kept from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Short-term durability is up to 100 years, medium-term is 100 to 1,000
years, and long-term is more than 1,000 years.</p>
<ul><li>Solutions that rely on Earth’s natural carbon cycle have short-term
durability measured in decades. For example, forestry projects have a
durability of 40 to 100 years.</li>
<li>Engineered solutions such as direct air capture often have long-term
durability measured in millennia. For example, direct air capture has a
durability of 10,000 years.</li>
<li>Long-term projects are typically orders of magnitude more expensive
than short-term projects. Once emitted, carbon remains in the atmosphere
for 5,000 years. To be considered net zero, carbon that has been emitted
needs to be permanently removed.</li>
</ul><p>A short-term carbon removal project will only remove carbon for 100
years, after which it is back in the atmosphere warming up our planet.
This is one of the reasons why abatement is preferred to neutralisation.
Never releasing carbon is far better than releasing carbon and then
trying to keep it out of the atmosphere for 5,000 years.</p>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="climate-commitments">Climate commitments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climate-commitments"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>There are many different emissions reduction strategies that an
organisation can commit to, from carbon neutral to net zero.
Understanding the different meanings and implications of each one and
finding out which are used by the facilities you use helps you
understand how your use of HPC fits within wider climate goals.</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/25_climate_commitments.png" title="Diagram illustrating different emissions reduction strategies" alt="Diagram illustrating different emissions reduction strategies" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating different emissions
reduction strategies</div>
</figure><div class="section level3">
<h3 id="carbon-neutral">Carbon Neutral<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-neutral"></a></h3>
<p>To achieve carbon neutrality, an organisation must measure its
emissions, then match the total to its emissions offsets through carbon
reduction projects. This can include carbon removal projects
(neutralisations) and carbon avoidance projects (compensations).</p>
<p>Carbon neutrality is defined by an internationally recognized
standard: <a href="https://info.eco-act.com/hubfs/0%20-%20Downloads/PAS%202060/PAS%202060%20factsheet%20EN.pdf" class="external-link">PAS
2060</a>. Although this does recommend an organisation sets abatement
targets, it does not demand they reduce their emissions. So to be
considered carbon neutral, an organisation can just measure and offset
without investing resources in eliminating their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>To be carbon neutral, you must cover direct emissions (scope 1 and
2). The general expectation is that organisations measure and offset
their scopes 1 and 2, and business travel from scope 3. However, there
is no specific requirement to include that.</p>
<p>Carbon neutral is a significant first step for any organisation since
it encourages measurement. However, there are not enough carbon offsets
in the world to offset the emissions of all the organisations.
Therefore, any strategy that does not include abatement will not scale
or help the world achieve the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Climate
Agreement. This is where net zero comes into play.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="net-zero">Net Zero<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#net-zero"></a></h3>
<p>Net zero means reducing emissions according to the latest climate
science and balancing remaining residual emissions through carbon
removals (neutralisations). Net zero, by definition, requires emissions
reductions in line with a 1.5°C pathway. All organisations must do this
to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>The critical differentiator between net zero and carbon neutral is
net zero’s focus on abatement rather than neutralisations and
compensations. A net-zero target aims to eliminate emissions and only to
use offsetting for the residual emissions that you cannot eliminate</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/foundations-for-net-zero-full-paper.pdf" class="external-link">standard
for net zero</a> is being developed by the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" class="external-link">Science Based Targets
initiative</a> (SBTi). They calculate that there is a 66% probability of
limiting global warming to 1.5°C if we reach a level of abatement of
about 90% of all GHG emissions by mid-century. So, to meet a net-zero
target, an organisation needs to eliminate 90% of its emissions by 2050.
The remaining emissions can only be offset using neutralisations and
permanent carbon removals.</p>
<p>A net-zero strategy would mean that the actual amount of carbon in
the atmosphere remains constant.</p>
<p>Also, to be a net-zero target, you must cover direct and indirect,
i.e. supply chain emissions (scopes 1,2 and 3). This is significant
since scope 3 often represents the majority of emissions.</p>
<p>Fo HPC facilities, part of these strategies include educating and
putting policies and approaches in place to support users to understand
and take action to reduce their emissions and maximise the carbon
efficiency of their HPC use.</p>

<h4 id="hpc-ci-as-part-of-a-net-zero-strategy">HPC-CI as part of a Net-Zero strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hpc-ci-as-part-of-a-net-zero-strategy"></a></h4>
<p>The HPC-CI is a metric specifically designed to drive the elimination
of emissions. The only way to reduce your rate is to invest time and
resources into actions that eliminate emissions. The only activities the
HPC-CI recognises as elimination actions are making your use of HPC
systems more energy-efficient, more hardware efficient, or consuming
lower-carbon energy sources. Offsets are an essential component of any
climate strategy; however, offsets are not eliminations and therefore
are not included in the HPC-CI metric.</p>
<p>Any net-zero strategy needs to have plans for how to both eliminate
as well as neutralise emissions. The HPC-CI helps organisations and
users drive the elimination of emissions due to HPC system use. This
makes the HPC-CI a useful component of any net-zero strategy for
operation and use of HPC systems.</p>

<h3 id="renewable">100% Renewable<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#renewable"></a></h3>
<p>When organisations set a target of 100% renewable power, they might
distinguish between being <strong>matched by</strong>
vs. <strong>powered by</strong> renewable energy sources.</p>
<p><strong>Powered by</strong> means you are directly powered by a
renewable power source, say a hydro dam. In that scenario, the energy
the device receives only originates from that source, so you can
confidently say that you are 100% powered by renewables.</p>
<p>For most people, we live on an interconnected grid, with many
producers pumping electricity in and many consumers taking electricity
out. This means the electrons coming into your device are a mixture of
all the electrons going into the grid. For example, suppose the grid
only has 5% of wind supply. You are getting 5% of wind-generated
electrons and 95% fossil fuel-generated electrons.</p>
<p>You cannot track individual electrons. Once the electrons from a wind
farm are on a grid, they all mix with the electrons from a fossil fuel
plant. So there is no way for a consumer to insist the electrons that it
uses only come from renewable sources.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="renewable-energy-certificates-rec">Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#renewable-energy-certificates-rec"></a></h4>
<p>To solve this problem, a renewable plant sells two things. The first
is its electricity, which it sells into a grid. The second is a REC, a
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" class="external-link">Renewable
Energy Certificates</a>. 1 REC equals 1 kWh of energy.</p>
<p>If you want to be 100% matched by renewable energy and are on the
grid, the solution is to buy enough RECs to cover the amount of
electricity you consume. For instance, if you consume 100 kWh of
electricity every day, then to be 100% matched by renewables, you buy
100 RECs.</p>
<p>When organizations set 100% renewable targets purchasing RECs on the
market is the solution they often employ to meet their commitments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="ppas">PPAs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ppas"></a></h4>
<p>You might also hear the term PPA used alongside RECs. A PPA is a <a href="https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sector/energy/energy-power-agreements/power-purchase-agreements" class="external-link">Power
Purchase Agreement</a>, which is another way to purchase RECs. If you
estimate you need 500 MWh of electricity per year for a particular data
center, you might sign a PPA to purchase 500 MWh per year from a
renewable plant. You would then get all the RECs associated with this
power plant.</p>
<p>PPAs are typically very long-term contracts. A renewable plant can
find financing with one of these agreements since it already has had a
buyer for its electricity for many years.</p>
<p>PPAs encourage something called <strong>additionality</strong>.
Purchasing a PPA drives the creation of new renewable plants. PPAs are a
solution that gets us towards a future where everyone has access to 100%
renewable energy.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="hourly-matching">24/7 Hourly Matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hourly-matching"></a></h3>
<p>When it comes to 100% renewable claims, the critical question is,
what is the granularity of matching? Do you sum up and net off yearly,
monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly? That question is essential because to
truly transition to renewable energy, we need 100% of the power to come
from low-carbon energy sources like renewables 100% of the time. This
fine granular matching is often called <em><a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/247-hourly-matching-electricity" class="external-link">24/7
hourly matching</a></em>.</p>
<p>24/7 hourly matching is one of the many strategies we need to employ
to help accelerate the transition to a 100% renewable-powered grid. For
example, <a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/" class="external-link">Google</a> and <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/14/made-to-measure-sustainability-commitment-progress-and-updates/" class="external-link">Microsoft</a>
have both committed to 24/7 hourly matching by 2030.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="daily-vs-hourly-matching">Daily vs hourly matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#daily-vs-hourly-matching"></a></h4>
<p>Imagine an organization has a demand curve like this, each blue
square represents 1kWh:</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/29_daily_consumption.png" title="Demand curve for electricity use" alt="Demand curve for electricity use" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Demand curve for electricity use</div>
</figure><p>They have purchased RECs from a wind farm that generated electricity
with a curve, so each green square represents 1 REC. Matching by day
means the organization consumed 18 kWh and bought 18 RECs. As a result,
they netted off to zero. So they can say they are <strong>100% matched
by renewable energy daily.</strong></p>
<p>However, if we looked at it in hourly buckets (each square here is 2
hrs in length), then it seems a bit different:</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/30_hourly_match.png" title="Diagram illustrating impact of hourly matching" alt="Diagram illustrating impact of hourly matching" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating impact of hourly
matching</div>
</figure><p>The total amount of energy consumed is still 18kWh. However, there
are only a few hours in the day where we are 100% matched by renewable
energy for that hour. So for some hours, we have way more renewable
energy than we need. Conversely, we have way less renewable energy than
we require for most hours.</p>
<p>In the above example, they are <strong>100% matched by renewable
energy on an hourly basis for only 6 hrs of the day</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="carbon-free-energy">Carbon-free energy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-free-energy"></a></h4>
<p>The number we use to describe how successful we are at 24/7 hourly
matching is the carbon-free energy percentage.</p>
<p>Carbon-free energy is defined as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon#understanding" class="external-link">the
average percentage of carbon-free energy consumed in a particular
location on an hourly basis</a>.</p>
<p>So for the previous example, if measured using daily matching, we are
100% matched with renewable energy. However, we are only 33.1% matched
if measured using hourly matching. <strong>The CFE percentage is,
therefore, 33.1%</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="carbon-awareness-as-part-of-a-247-hourly-matching-strategy">Carbon Awareness as part of a 24/7 Hourly Matching Strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-awareness-as-part-of-a-247-hourly-matching-strategy"></a></h4>
<p>Carbon aware computing involves responding to electrical carbon
intensity signals and changing the <strong>behavior</strong> of
software, so it emits less carbon. Carbon awareness also helps an
organisation meet their 24/7 hourly matching target and increase its CFE
percentage.</p>
<p>One example of a behavior change is shifting compute to a time when
more renewable energy is available. For example, delaying the start of a
power intensive simulation (or even delaying charging of a laptop) to

<hr class="half-width"><p>We have mentioned above how the HPC-CI metric is designed to drive
abatement of emissions but how can users of HPC systems, operators of
HPC systems and organisations that procure HPC systems actually improve
the HPC-CI metric? We try to answer this question in this section but it
is worth nothing that action is required by all of these parties to
reduce emissions from HPC systems.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>While we cover strategies for reducing emissions from (roughly) a
constant amount of HPC use or HPC provision it is clear that a key part
(possibly the most important part) of reduction of emissions from HPC
use is a reduction in the consumption and provision of HPC. At a
fundamental level we need to reduce the amount of compute we are using
and the amount of compute hardware we are buying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We seem to need reminding that computing is not exempt from having
to drastically reduce emissions. Instead of assuming computing can
innovate the path to a greater future, the bravest and most heroic
action the computing sector could take is to show restraint and
leadership, …”</p>

<p>Before we delve into different approaches for different components of
the HPC-CI equation, there is a high level consideration that can reduce
both the <code>E</code> and <code>M</code> terms in the HPC-CI equation
simultaneously:</p>
<p><strong>Ensure any use of HPC is useful</strong> - this sounds
obvious but most HPC users will have had the experience of running jobs
on HPC systems which consume resources but do not produce useful output
due to errors in the software, in the input parameters or even in the
script that runs the job. To improve the HPC-CI rate:</p>
<ul><li>Ensure that the jobs you are running will produce useful/significant
output even if they run correctly - do not run calculations/jobs without
a clear understanding of what they add to the research project.</li>
<li>Carefully test input files and job scripts with small/short jobs
before running at large scale to reduce the likelihood of wasted
emissions.</li>
<li>Consider if you can achieve the same project goals with fewer
jobs/calculations. For example, optimise the sampling choices when
exploring parameter spaces.</li>
</ul><p>Other strategies for improving the HPC-CI metric and, so, reducing
emissions do depend on whether the dominant component is operational
emissions (i.e. emissions from energy use) or the embodied emissions. If
the components are evenly balanced then you should look at options from
both sections.</p>
<p><strong>Operational emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Improve the energy efficiency of your use - this may involve power
or frequency capping of the hardware you are using. (This improves the
ratio of <code>E</code> to <code>R</code> in the HPC-CI equation.)</li>
<li>Temporal shifting - run when carbon intensity is lower. (Reduces
<code>I</code>.)</li>
<li>Spatial shifting - run on system where carbon intensity is lower,
run on hardware which has better energy efficiency for your use case
(e.g. GPU may be more energy efficient for your use). (Reduces
<code>I</code>, or improves the ratio of <code>E</code> to
<code>R</code>.)</li>
<li>Run fewer calculations/jobs. (Reduces <code>E</code> and
<code>M</code>.)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Embodied emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Improve the performance of your use - more output per unit of time
(even at the expense of energy efficiency by removing any power).
(improves the ratio of <code>M</code> to <code>R</code>.)</li>
<li>Spatial shifting - run on system which has lower embodied emissions
rate for your use. (Reduces <code>M</code>.)</li>
<li>Run fewer calculations/jobs. (Reduces <code>E</code> and
<code>M</code>.)</li>

<h3 id="operators-and-procuring-hpc-systems">Operators and procuring HPC systems<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#operators-and-procuring-hpc-systems"></a></h3>
<p>For operators of HPC systems and organisations that are procuring HPC
systems, many of the strategies above have equivalents. In all cases,
evaluation of the emissions of the system must be taken into account as
a core part of HPC system procurement and operations. It is also
critical that emissions information is made available to users to allow
them to compute metrics such as the HPC-CI rate to allow them to work to
reduce emissions from their use of HPC systems.</p>
<p><strong>Operational emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Improve the energy efficiency of your HPC systems - this may involve
power or frequency capping of the hardware you are providing or
purchasing hardware that is more energy efficient for the system use
cases.</li>
<li>Ensure that the power and cooling plant are as efficient as possible
to minimise overheads.</li>
<li>Enable temporal shifting (either automatically or user controlled) -
for example, run workloads with higher power intensities at times when
carbon intensity is lower.</li>
<li>Spatial shifting - site HPC systems in locations that have the
lowest carbon intensities.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Embodied emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Work with users to improve the performance of jobs on the service -
more output per unit of time (even at the expense of energy efficiency
by removing any power).</li>
<li>Extend the lifetime of the service as long as possible to extract
maximum value from the emissions already in the atmosphere from purchase
of the HPC system.</li>
<li>Purchase HPC systems that have the best ratio of embodied emissions
to performance for the workloads that will be run.</li>

<h3 class="callout-title">Key Points</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<ul><li>There are a number of methodologies commonly applied to help in the
overall fight against climate change. These fall into the general
categories of carbon elimination (also known as “abatement”), carbon
avoidance (a.k.a. “compensating”), or carbon removal (a.k.a.
“neutralising”).</li>
<li>Abatement is the most effective way to fight climate change although
complete carbon elimination is not possible.</li>
<li>Compensating includes the adoption of renewable energy sources,
sustainable living practices, recycling, planting trees etc.</li>
<li>Neutralisations refer to the removal and permanent storage of
atmospheric carbon to counterbalance the effect of releasing CO2 into
the atmosphere. Neutralisations tend to remove the carbon from the
atmosphere in the short and medium-term.</li>
<li>Net zero aims to eliminate emissions and only offset the residual
emissions that you cannot eliminate to reach the 1.5°C target set by the
Paris Climate Agreement.</li>
<li>Which strategies users or HPC system operators prioritise to reduce
emissions depends on if the operational or embodied emissions
dominate.</li>
<li>A key part of reducing emissions from HPC use is reducing our
consumption of HPC resources.</li>
