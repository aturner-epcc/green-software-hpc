<p>Green software is an emerging discipline at the intersection of
climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and
data center design.</p>
<p>Green software use is carbon-efficient software use, meaning it emits
the least carbon possible. Only three activities reduce the carbon
emissions of software; energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware
efficiency.</p>
<p>This workshop will explain all of these concepts, how to apply them
to use cases on high-performance computing (HPC) systems and how to
measure them, as well as some of the international guidelines and
organisations that guide and monitor this space.</p>

<p>Anyone involved in using HPC resources - either as a user, a
developer of software for use on HPC or even professionals. By studying
these principles, you will be able to better understand the effect of
their use of HPC on carbon emissions, where it fits with emissions from
your other activities and what concrete actions you can take to reduce
your emissions and the size of the impact from these reductions.</p>

<p>In 2019 the original eight principles of green software engineering
were released. This 2022 update of the principles took on feedback
received over the years, merging some principles and adding a new one

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Above, we described the <strong>principles</strong> of green
software, a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run
green software. To support software engineers in this area, The Green
Software Foundation has developed a catalogue of <em>green software
patterns</em>. While not specific to use of HPC and aimed at software
developers rather than users, they provide interesting information on
how particular software types and their use can be made more
environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>A green software <a href="https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/" class="external-link"><strong>pattern</strong></a>
is a specific example of how to apply one or more principles in a
real-world example. Whereas principles describe the theory that
underpins green software, patterns are the practical advice software
practitioners can use in their software applications today. Patterns are
vendor-neutral.</p>
<p>A green software <strong>practice</strong> is a pattern applied to a
specific vendor’s product and informs practitioners about how to use
that product in a more sustainable way.</p>
<p>Practices should refer to patterns that should refer to
principles.</p>
<p>The green software foundation publishes a <a href="https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/" class="external-link">catalog of

<p>Use of HPC will be only one part of your research activities and may
not even be the largest source of carbon emissions (though this does not
mean you should not work to make your use of HPC more carbon
efficient!). As well as understanding your carbon emissions from HPC,
which this workshop will help you do, you also need to assess other
activities you undertake as part of your research and try to estimate
emissions associated with them.</p>

<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/" class="external-link">Global
warming</a> is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed
since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human
activities, primarily fossil fuel burning. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/" class="external-link">Climate
change</a> is long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have
been the main driver of climate change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="climate-vs-weather">Climate vs weather<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climate-vs-weather"></a>
</h3>
<p>Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere in a short period
of time. Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over long
periods of time. Any changes to the long-term condition of the
atmosphere will also cause changes to the short-term conditions. Some
examples of measurable changes to weather conditions due to climate
change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the water cycle, including rainfall</li>
<li>Melting of ice</li>
<li>Heating of the land, air, and ocean</li>
<li>Changes in ocean currents, acidity, and salinity</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes can lead to flooding - both in coastal areas and due to
increased rainfall - drought, wildfires and more frequent extreme
weather conditions.</p>

<h3 id="greenhouse-gases-and-the-greenhouse-effect">Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#greenhouse-gases-and-the-greenhouse-effect"></a>
</h3>
<p>Greenhouse gases are a group of gases that trap heat from solar
radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases act as a blanket,
increasing the temperature on the surface of the Earth. This is a
natural phenomenon which has been accelerated due to man-made carbon
emissions. Now the global climate is changing at a faster rate than that
at which animals and plants can adapt.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect are crucial to all life on
Earth and often come from natural sources like animals, volcanoes, and
other geological activity. The greenhouse effect allows the Earth to
maintain a higher temperature than it would without them by capturing
more heat from solar radiation. Like many other natural processes of the
Earth, the greenhouse effect is a balance that can be upset by multiple
factors.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-and-co2e">Carbon and CO<sub>2</sub>e<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-and-co2e"></a>

<p>Carbon is often used as a broad term to refer to the impact of all
types of emissions and activities on global warming. CO<sub>2</sub>e
(sometimes: CO<sub>2</sub>eq/CO<sub>2</sub>-eq), which stands for
<em>carbon equivalence</em>, is a measurement term used to measure this
impact. For example, 1 ton of methane has the same warming effect as
about <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/oil-gas-and-coal/methane-emissions_en" class="external-link">84
tons of CO<sub>2</sub> over 20 years</a>, so we normalise it to 84 tons
CO<sub>2</sub>e. We may shorten even further to just carbon, which is a
term often used to refer to all GHGs.</p>

Climate Agreement</strong></a> is an international treaty agreed in 2015
by 196 parties and the UN to reduce the Earth’s temperature increase.
The agreement is to keep the rise in global mean temperature to 2°C
compared to pre-industrial levels, with a preferable lower limit of
1.5°C. The agreement is reviewed every five years and mobilizes finance
to developing nations to mitigate the impacts of climate change and
prepare for and adapt to the environmental effects caused by climate
change. In addition, each party is expected to update its progress
through a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). As of October 2024,

<p>In the HPC space, the part we play in the climate solution is
<strong>using HPC systems in a carbon efficient way</strong>. Being
carbon efficient is about making sure your use of HPC emits the least
carbon possible for the work we are doing. Or, for providers of HPC
systems, it means procuring and operating the system in such a way as to
minimise the carbon emissions. Ideally, you would also be able to
quantify the <strong>positive</strong> carbon impacts from the work (or
HPC system itself) to understand the overall net impact on carbon
emissions - though doing this is typically quite challenging.</p>

<p>The main source of reduced emissions from HPC use is in the research

emissions. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HPC services run the climate models that are used to provide
evidence for setting emissions reductions policies and targets across
the world. Research and modelling on HPC services leads to development
of improved zero emission energy generation by, for example, modelling
new wind turbine and wind farm designs.</li>
<li>Modelling to support the development of new energy storage
technologies such as improved batteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The emissions reductions from such activities are extremely difficult
to quantify for a number of reasons so, at the moment, these are not
factored in to the emissions estimates for HPC systems and research more
broadly but you should be aware of them and think about how they might
apply to your research in particular.</p>
<p>As well as the research activities on HPC systems leading to
reductions in emissions, there are other activities that HPC services
can potentially take to have positive emissions impacts, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the waste heat generated by large scale HPC services as a heat
source for homes, businesses or farming. For example, the LUMI HPC
system in Finland is connected to the district heat network for the
local city of Kaajani and helps heat homes and businesses.</li>
<li>Incorporating environmental and biodiversity improvements into the
service. For example, for the ACF data centre that hosts ARCHER2 (which
is in a rural location) EPCC have been working to improve the site
biodiversity and improve habitats.</li>
<li>Responsible carbon offset schemes could also potentially be used to
reduce emissions if they are undertaken as part of providing an HPC
service.</li>

<p>Energy is the ability to do work. There are many different forms of
energy, such as heat, electrical and chemical, and one type of energy
can be converted to another. For example, we convert chemical energy in
coal to electrical energy. In other words, electricity is secondary
energy converted from another energy type. In this way, we can think of
energy as a measure of the electricity used.</p>
<p>All software, from large scale modelling and simulation on HPC, to
the training of Machine Learning models, to the applications running on
mobile phones consumes electricity. One of the best ways to reduce
electricity consumption and the subsequent carbon emissions made by
software is to make make our use of HPC facilities more energy
efficient.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Do renewable energy sources have zero carbon emissions?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The use of low-carbon sources of electricity such as wind or
hydroelectric also reduce the emissions from the electricity we consume
by our use of HPC. However, even renewable electricity sources have a
carbon cost from the manufacture, operation and decommissioning of the
energy source (e.g. wind farm) so there are always reductions in
emissions to be gained from reducing energy use. We will talk about how
you estimate the impact of different emissions sources, including
electricity use, later in this workshop so you can prioritise your
effort where it will have the most impact.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reduction of energy consumed by work on an HPC system depends on
a lot of things, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the design and algorithm choices of the software engineers who wrote
the software;</li>
<li>the technology of the HPC system itself;</li>
<li>how the source code is interpreted by compilers to produce
machine-executable code (including compiler optimisations);</li>
<li>the input and setup of the software given by the user
themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the different people involved at different stages can impact the
energy efficiency of the use case on the HPC system. Some people will
only be able to impact one aspect but many people are involved in more
than one of these aspects. For example, most researchers using HPC
systems make use of software (specifying inputs and specifying the
parallel distribution of work) and also design and write their own
software (even if this is analysis scripts in a language such as
Python).</p>
<p>Collectively, we all take responsibility for the energy consumed by
HPC systems and design them and the software that runs on them, and use
the software on them to consume as little energy as possible. We should
make sure that, at every step in the process, there is as little wasted
energy as possible.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at some of these concepts and some ways that you
can become more energy efficient at every stage.</p>

</h3>
<p>Across the world, a lot of electricity is produced through burning
fossil fuels, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-electricity-by-source" class="external-link">usually
coal or gas</a>. Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and
animals. These fuels are found in the Earth’s crust and contain carbon
and hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, oil, and natural gas
are examples of fossil fuels.</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/04_high-carbon_sources.png" title="Diagram of link from fossil fuels to energy" alt="Diagram of link from fossil fuels to energy" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram of link from fossil fuels to
energy</div>
</figure><p>Most people think electricity is clean. Our hands do not get dirty
when we plug something into a wall, and our laptops do not need exhaust
pipes. However, in some geographical regions most electricity comes from
burning fossil fuels and energy supply is the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/change-of-co2-eq-emissions-2#tab-chart_4" class="external-link">single
most significant</a> cause of carbon emissions. For HPC services hosted
in such locations, we can draw a direct line from electricity to carbon
emissions and, hence, electricity can be considered a proxy for carbon.
If our goal is to be carbon efficient in out use of HPC hosted in these
regions, then it means our goal is also to be energy efficient since
energy is a proxy for carbon. This means using the least amount of
energy possible per unit of work.</p>
<p>In the UK (where ARCHER2 is housed), GHG emissions from energy
generation in 2023 make up a much smaller proportion of emissions -
11.5% of total UK emissions. This is the 5th largest component of UK
emissions, behind domestic transport (29%), buildings and product use
(20%), industry (15%) and agriculture (12%). The emissions from
electricity generation have dropped by over 78% from 1990 to 2023. (Data
from UK Government: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6604460f91a320001a82b0fd/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-provisional-figures-statistical-release-2023.pdf" class="external-link">2023
UK greenhouse gas emissions, provisional figures</a>.) In locations
where electricity generation is decarbonising so quickly, measuring
electricity use from our use of HPC and using it as proxy for carbon
does not make as much sense as for regions where electricity generation
has a large component generated by burning fossil fuels. Reducing
electricity use is still part of the goal of greener use of HPC but
other (embodied) sources of emissions become more important. We will
discuss this later in this workshop.</p>

from coal to gas in the 1990s, and more recently to renewable energy
sources. This was combined with lower electricity demand, owing to
greater efficiency resulting from improvements in technology and a

<p>Now that we know how energy is produced and the associated cost in
terms of emissions, based on whether low- or high-carbon energy sources
are used. There are other concepts associated with operating HPC
services that impact how much energy is used and so our energy
efficiency. In particular, <em>Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)</em> and
<em>Energy proportiionality</em>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="power-usage-effectiveness">Power usage effectiveness<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#power-usage-effectiveness"></a>
</h3>
<p>The data center industry uses the <a href="https://datacenters.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/WP49-PUE%20A%20Comprehensive%20Examination%20of%20the%20Metric_v6.pdf" class="external-link">power
usage effectiveness</a> (PUE) metric, developed by Green Grid in 2006,
to <strong>measure data center energy efficiency</strong>. Specifically,
this relates to how much energy the computing equipment uses as compared
to cooling and other overheads supporting the equipment. When a data
center’s PUE is close to 1.0, computing is using nearly all energy. When
the PUE is 2.0, this means an additional watt of power is required to
cool and distribute power to the HPC equipment for every watt of HPC
power it uses.</p>
<p>Another way to think of PUE is as a multiplier to your energy
consumption when using HPC. So, for example, if your use consumed 10 kWh
and the PUE of the data center where it is running is 1.5, then the
actual consumption from the grid is 15 kWh: 5kWh goes towards the
operational overhead of the data center, and 10 kWh goes to the servers
that are running your application.</p>

(PUE) of data centres</div>
</figure><p>In many cases, PUE is not constant over time for the data centres
that host HPC systems. The PUE value often depends on how much energy is
required to cool the system. This obviously varies with load (as the
more work a system is doing, the more power it is drawing and the more
cooling it requires) but it often also varies with atmospheric
conditions - the cooler the air temperature is, the less additional
power you need to draw to cool the HPC system. HPC systems hosted in
cooler locations can often make use of “free cooling” where
refrigeration technology is not required to cool the system, the outside
air (or water) temperature is cool enough to do this without the need
for mechanical cooling.</p>

<p>The PUE of the Advanced Data Centre (ACF) facility that hosts the

</h3>
<p><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub33387/" class="external-link">Energy
proportionality</a>, first proposed in 2007 by engineers at Google,
measures <strong>the relationship between power consumed by a computer
and the rate at which useful work is done</strong> (its
utilisation).</p>
<p>Utilisation measures how much of a computer’s resources are used,
usually given as a percentage. A fully utilised computer running at its
maximum capacity has a high percentage, while an idle computer with no
utilisation has a lower percentage.</p>
<p>The relationship between power and utilisation is not linearly
proportional. Mathematically speaking, linear proportionality between
two variables means their ratios are equivalent. As an example of the
nonlinear realtionship between utilisation and power draw, at 0%
utilisation, a computer may draw 100 W; at 50%, it draws 180 W; and at
100%, it draws 200 W. The relationship between power consumption and
utiliation is not linear and does not cross the origin.</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/06_energy_proportionality_updated.png" title="Schematic graph showing relationship between power draw and utilisation of computer infrastructure" alt="Schematic graph showing relationship between power draw and utilisation of computer infrastructure" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Schematic graph showing relationship between
power draw and utilisation of computer infrastructure</div>
</figure><p>Because of this, the more we utilise a computer, the more efficient
it becomes at converting electricity to practical computing operations.
One way to improve hardware efficiency is to run the workload on as few
servers as possible, with the servers running at the highest utilisation
rate, maximising energy efficiency.</p>
<p>However, the story for HPC use is actually less straightforward than
this description. The energy proportionality argument holds when the
performance of an application is <em>compute bound</em> - that is, when
the output from the application you are running is strongly correlated
with the performance of the processors (actually, for HPC, it is
typically the performance of the floating point units in the
processors). The performance of many HPC applications is actually
<em>memory-bound</em> so the performance is dependent on the performance
of data moving from memory to be processed. In these cases, once you are
above a certain performance threshold for the floating point units any
additional power draw does not lead to increased utilisation
(i.e. useful performance for the application); the more you you utilise
the processor, the more power you draw but you do not get any additional
useful performance so this is just wasted electricity, reducing the
energy efficiency of your use. It becomes even more complex as you run
parallel applications (as typically happens on HPC resources) as the
change in parallel distribution can change the balance between compute
bound and memory bound performance for your application; meaning that
you may need to choose different strategies to maximise energy
efficiency at different parallelisations even for the same problem and
software.</p>

<p>Performance of HPC applications can be: compute-bound, memory-bound,
IO-bound, communications-bound and the utilisation argument made above
only really applies to applications where performance is strongly
compute-bound. In reality, the performance of most HPC applications is
bound by different limits at different stages in their execution
(e.g. IO-bound while reading in large datasets, compute-bound while
calculating) and so a theoretical analysis of how the energy consumption
changes as a function of processor utilisation is difficult to
perform.</p>

<h4 id="static-power-draw">Static power draw<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#static-power-draw"></a>
</h4>
<p>The static power draw of a computer is <strong>how much electricity
is drawn when in an idle state</strong>. The static power draw varies by
configuration and hardware components, but all parts have some static
power draw. This is one of the reasons that PCs, laptops, and end-user
devices have power-saving modes. If the device is idle, it will
eventually trigger a hibernation mode and put the disk and screen to
sleep or even change the CPU’s frequency. These power-saving modes save
on electricity, but they have other trade-offs, such as a slower restart
when the device wakes up.</p>
<p>HPC systems are usually not configured for aggressive or even minimal
power saving when idle. Many use cases running on servers demand total
capacity as quickly as possible because the server needs to respond to
rapidly changing demands, which leads to many servers in idle modes
during low-demand periods. An idle server has a carbon cost from both
the embedded carbon as well as its inefficient utilisation. This is one
reason why the goal of many HPC systems is to maximise utilisation.</p>

</h3>
<p>Given this complexity, what practical steps can you take to decide on
how to run in an energy-efficient manner on HPC systems? The answer is
to run some test cases and measure the energy consumption and
performance, then change parameters (such as processor power cap, or
number of parallel processes) and measure again to see what the impact
is on both performance and energy consumption. Using a benchmarking
approach such as this, you can practically improve the energy efficiency
of your use of HPC.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a developer of the software you are using then
you may also be able to change the algorithms, data layout and other
aspects of the software to improve energy efficiency. Such approaches
are beyond the scope of this workshop but benchmarking energy
consumption also form a core component of this work.</p>

resources hosted in data centres more generally).</li>
<li>How you go about improving the energy efficiency of use of an HPC

<p>Not all electricity is produced in the same way. In different
locations and times, electricity is generated using a variety of sources
with varying carbon emissions. Some sources, such as wind, solar, or
hydroelectric, are clean, renewable sources that emit little carbon. On
the other hand, fossil fuel sources emit carbon at varying degrees to
produce electricity. For example, both gas and coal emit more carbon
than renewable sources, but gas-burning power plants emit less carbon
than coal-burning power plants.</p>
<p>Carbon awareness is the idea of doing more when more energy comes
from low carbon sources and doing less when more energy comes from high
carbon sources.</p>

<p>Carbon intensity measures how much carbon (CO<sub>2</sub>e) is
emitted per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity consumed. The standard
unit of carbon intensity is gCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh, or grams of carbon per
kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>If your computer is plugged directly into a wind farm, its
electricity would have a carbon intensity of 0 gCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh
since a wind farm emits no carbon to produce that electricity. However,
most people can’t plug directly into wind farms; instead, they plug into
power grids supplied with electricity from various sources.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Embodied carbon of renewable sources</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In reality, the carbon intensity of renewable sources still have some
GHG emissions associated with them from the emissions used to build,
operate and decommission them. As we will se in a later episode, these
emissions are usually amortised across the lifetime of the facility (in
this case, the lifetime of the generation facility). By convention,
these embodied emissions are not usually included in carbon intensity
values for generated energy as they are complex to calculate and the
emissions saved by replacing non-renewable sources with renewable
sources have vastly outweighed the embodied emissions of renewable
sources. These emissions sources will become a more important component
of energy generation as electricity grids continue to decarbonise.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once on a grid, you can not control which sources supply the
electricity you are using; you simply get a mix of everything. So, your
carbon intensity will be a mix of all the current power sources in a
grid, both the lower- and the higher-carbon sources.</p>

<p>Carbon intensity also changes over time due to the inherent
variability of renewable energy caused by the unpredictability of
weather conditions. For example, when it’s cloudy or the wind isn’t
blowing, carbon intensity increases since more of the electricity in
your mix comes from sources that emit carbon.</p>

<h3 id="dispatchability-curtailment">Dispatchability &amp; curtailment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dispatchability-curtailment"></a>
</h3>
<p>Electricity demand varies during the day and supply always needs to
be able to meet that demand. A brownout (a dip in the voltage level of
the power line) occurs if a utility does not produce enough electricity
to meet demand. Conversely, if a utility produces more electricity than
is required, then to stop infrastructure burning out, breakers trip and
we have blackouts.</p>
<p>There needs to be a balance between the demand and supply of
electricity at all times and the responsibility for this usually falls
to the utility provider.</p>
<p>In the case of fossil fuels such as coal, it is easier to control the
power produced for this supply; this is called
<strong>dispatchability</strong>. However, in the case of renewable
power sources such as wind farms, the power produced cannot easily be
controlled (we cannot control how much the wind blows). If the power
source produces more electricity than is needed, that electricity is
thrown away; this is called <strong>curtailment</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="marginal-carbon-intensity">Marginal carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#marginal-carbon-intensity"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you suddenly need to access more power - for example, you need to
turn on a light - that energy comes from the marginal power plant. The
marginal power plant is dispatchable, which means marginal power plants
are often powered by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Marginal carbon intensity is the carbon intensity of the power plant
that would have to be employed to meet any new demand.</p>
<p>Fossil-fueled power plants rarely scale down to 0. They have a
minimum functioning threshold, and some do not scale; they are
considered a consistent, always-on baseload. Because of this, we
sometimes have the scenario where we curtail (throw away) renewable
energy while still consuming energy from fossil fuel power plants.</p>

renewable energy we are curtailing.</p>

<h3 id="energy-markets">Energy markets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#energy-markets"></a>
</h3>
<p>The exact market model varies around the world but broadly follows
the same model.</p>
<p>When the demand for electricity goes down, utilities need to
<strong>reduce</strong> the supply to balance supply and demand. They
can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Buy less energy from fossil fuel plants.</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="./fig/10_marginal_CI.png" title="Diagram illustrating reduction in demand from fossil fuel plants" alt="Diagram illustrating reduction in demand from fossil fuel plants" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating reduction in demand from
fossil fuel plants</div>
</figure><p>Energy from fossil fuel plants is usually the most expensive so this
is the preferred method. This directly translates to burning fewer
fossil fuels.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Buy less energy from renewable sources</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Renewable sources are the cheapest, so they prefer not to do this. If
a renewable source does not manage to sell all of its electricity, it
has to throw the rest away.</p>
<p>Reducing the amount of electricity consumed by your use of HPC can
help decrease the energy’s carbon intensity as the first thing to be
scaled back are fossil fuels.</p>
<p>When the demand for electricity goes up, utilities need to increase
the supply to balance supply and demand. They can do this in one of two
ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Buy more energy from renewable sources that are currently
being curtailed</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="./fig/10_marginal_CI.png" title="Diagram illustrating increase in demand from renewable sources" alt="Diagram illustrating increase in demand from renewable sources" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating increase in demand from
renewable sources</div>
</figure><p>If you are curtailing, it means you have excess energy you could
dispatch. Renewable energy is already the cheapest, so curtailed
renewable energy will be the cheapest dispatchable energy source.
Renewable plants will then sell the energy they would have had to
curtail.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Buy more energy from fossil fuel plants</strong>.</li>
</ol>

non-renewable sources</div>
</figure><p>Fossil fuels are inherently dispatchable; they can quickly increase
energy production by burning more. However, coal costs money, so this is
the least preferred solution.</p>
<p>Energy markets are some of the most complex markets in the world so
the above explanation is a simplification. But what is important to
understand is that our goal is to increase investment into lower carbon
energy sources, like renewables, and decrease investment into higher
carbon sources, like coal. The best way to ensure money flows in the
right direction is to make sure you use electricity with the least
carbon intensity.</p>

</figure><p>There is a global transformation happening right now. All around the
world, electricity grids are changing from primarily burning fossil
fuels to sourcing energy from lower carbon sources like wind and solar.
This is one of our best hopes for meeting our global reduction targets.
As green users of HPC, let’s see some of the ways we can help accelerate
that transition.</p>
<p>The primary driver for the transition is economic rather than any
sustainability target. Renewables are winning because they are cheaper
and getting even more affordable over time. So, to help accelerate the
transition, we need to make renewable plants more profitable and fossil
fuel plants less profitable. The best way to do that is to use more
electricity when it’s coming from lower-carbon sources like renewables
and less electricity when it’s coming from higher-carbon sources.</p>
<p>Carbon intensity is lower when more energy comes from lower-carbon
sources and higher when it comes from higher-carbon sources.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="demand-shifting">Demand shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#demand-shifting"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being carbon aware means responding to shifts in carbon intensity by
increasing or decreasing your demand. If your work allows you to be
flexible with when and where you run workloads, you can shift
accordingly - consuming electricity when the carbon intensity is lower
and pausing production when it is higher. For example, running a
simulation or model at a different time or region with much lower carbon
intensity.</p>
<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6128960" class="external-link">Studies</a>
show these actions can result in 45% to 99% carbon reductions depending
on the number of renewables powering the grid.</p>
<p>Demand shifting can be further broken down into spatial and temporal
shifting.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="spatial-shifting">Spatial shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-shifting"></a>
</h4>
<p>Spatial shifting means moving your computation to another physical
location where the current carbon intensity is lower. It might be a
region that naturally has lower carbon sources of energy. For example,
using an HPC facility sited in a location that is currently windy and so
has a high proportion of wind power.</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/14_spatial_shifting.png" title="Diagram illustrating spatial demand shifting" alt="Diagram illustrating spatial demand shifting" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating spatial demand
shifting</div>
</figure><p>This requires you to have the ability to run on different HPC
resources in different locations - for example, you could chose between
running on a local HPC resource or a national HPC resource located
elsewhere.</p>
<!-- TODO: Maybe add advantages and disadvantages -->
<!-- TODO: Also mention impact of cooling overheads, different seasons in different hemispheres, cooler locations -->
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="temporal-shifting">Temporal shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#temporal-shifting"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you cannot shift your computation spatially to another region,
another option you have is to shift to another time. Perhaps later in
the day or night when it’s sunnier or windier and, therefore, the carbon
intensity is lower. This is called temporal demand shifting. We can
predict future carbon intensity reasonably well through advances in
weather forecasting.</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/15_temporal_shifting.png" title="Diagram illustrating spatial demand shifting" alt="Diagram illustrating spatial demand shifting" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating spatial demand

</figure><p>An example of a service that can predict carbon intensity to enable
temporal demand shifting is the <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk" class="external-link">carbonintensity.org.uk website and
API</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the large technology companies have recognised the importance
of carbon awareness and are using advanced modeling techniques to
implement demand shifting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Google Carbon Aware Data Centers</strong> - Google launched
a project to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/carbon-aware-computing-location/" class="external-link">make
some of the cloud workloads carbon aware</a>. They created models to
predict tomorrow’s carbon intensity and workload. They then shaped
large-scale workloads so more would happen when and where the carbon
intensity is lowest, but in such a way that they could still handle the
expected load.</li>
<li>
<strong>Microsoft Carbon Aware Windows</strong> - <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-11-is-getting-an-eco-friendly-update-but-could-microsoft-do-more" class="external-link">Microsoft
announced a project to make Windows 11 more sustainable</a>. Initially,
this means running Windows updates when the carbon intensity is

</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="demand-shaping">Demand shaping<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#demand-shaping"></a>
</h3>
<p>Demand shifting is the strategy of moving computation to regions or
times when the carbon intensity is lowest. Demand shaping is a similar
strategy. However, instead of moving demand to a different region or
time, we shape our computation to match the existing supply.</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/16_demand_shaping.png" title="Diagram illustrating demand shaping" alt="Diagram illustrating demand shaping" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating demand shaping</div>
</figure><ul>
<li>If carbon intensity is low, increase the demand; do more (or faster)
calculations.</li>
<li>If carbon intensity is high, decrease demand; do less (or slower)
calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Demand shaping for carbon-aware HPC use is all about the supply of
carbon. When the carbon cost of running your simulation or model becomes
high, shape the demand to match the supply of carbon. This can happen
automatically, or the user can make a choice.</p>
<p>Eco mode is an example of demand shaping. Eco modes are found in
everyday appliances like cars or washing machines. When activated, some
amount of performance is sacrificed in order to consume fewer resources
(gas or electricity). Because there is this trade-off with performance,
eco modes are always presented to a user as a choice.</p>
<p>Software or HPC services can also have eco modes that can - either
automatically or with user consent - make decisions to reduce carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>One example of this is video conferencing software that adjusts
streaming quality automatically. Rather than streaming at the highest
quality possible at all times, it reduces the video quality to
prioritise audio when the bandwidth is low.</p>
<p>Another example is TCP/IP. The transfer speed increases in response
to how much data is broadcast over the wire.</p>
<p>A third example is progressive enhancement with the web. The web
experience improves depending on the resources and bandwidth available
on the end user’s device.</p>
<p>Demand shaping is related to a broader concept in sustainability,
which is to reduce consumption. We can achieve a lot by becoming more
efficient with resources, but we also need to consume less at some
point.</p>
<p>As green users of HPC, we would consider cancelling or reducing the
power intensity of our workflow when the carbon intensity is high
instead of demand shifting - reducing the energy demands of our
work.</p>

<p>The device you are using to read this on produced carbon when it was
manufactured and, once it reaches the end of life, disposing of it may
release more. Embodied carbon (also referred to as “embedded carbon”) is
the amount of carbon pollution emitted during the creation and disposal
of a device.</p>
<p>When calculating the total carbon pollution for HPC services, both
the carbon pollution associated with running the system as well as the
embodied carbon of the system must be accounted for.</p>

</figure><p>Embodied carbon varies significantly between different hardware. For
some devices, the carbon emitted during manufacturing is much higher
than that emitted during usage, as illustrated by a <a href="https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:fa4e956e-7a53-4038-98a5-00e09e2f4303/Study_Digitalization_Climate_Protection_Summary_Oct2017.pdf" class="external-link">study</a>
from University of Zurich. As a result, the embodied carbon cost can
sometimes be much higher than the carbon cost of the electricity
powering it.</p>
<p>By thinking in terms of embodied carbon, any device, even one not
consuming electricity, is responsible for the release of carbon over its
lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="amortisation">Amortisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#amortisation"></a>

<p>A way to account for embodied carbon is to amortise the carbon over
the expected life span of a device. For example, suppose it took
4000 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e to build an HPC system, and we expect it to last
four years. Amortisation means that we can say the HPC system emits
1000 kgCO2<sub>e</sub>/year.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>If we take into account the embodied carbon, it is clear that by the
time we come to install an HPC system, it’s already emitted a good deal
of carbon. Computers also have a limited lifespan, which means they
eventually are unable to handle modern workloads, or suffer failures and
need to be replaced. In these terms, hardware consumption is a proxy for
carbon, and since our goal is to be carbon efficient, we must also be
hardware efficient.</p>
<p>There are two main approaches to hardware efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Extending the lifespan</strong> of the hardware - which
reduces the carbon emission rate per unit of time due to
amortisation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Increasing the utilisation and performance</strong> of the
hardware - getting more useful work out of the hardware per unit of

<p>In the example we saw previously, if we can add just one more year to
the lifespan of our HPC system, then the amortised carbon emissions rate
drops from 1000 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/year to
800 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/year.</p>

which point they are replaced by newer systems that provide improved
performance and functionality and that are typically more energy
efficient. However, extending the lifetime of HPC systems for longer
periods may lead to improved carbon efficiency and using older HPC
systems for our research may lead to more carbon efficient use of
HPC.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Understanding what is the most carbon efficient way to make use of
HPC systems (and the most carbon efficient way to operate then,
including choosing their lifetime) can be complex as it depends on many
factors: the embodied carbon of the hardware, the lifetime, the carbon
intensity of the electricity supply and how that changes over the
service lifetime, how efficiently the workload you are running runs on
the type of hardware provided by the system. However, one key aspect of
being able to use HPC in a carbon efficient way is for your workflow to
have the flexibility to run on different system types in an efficient
manner.</p>

</h3>
<p>As well as increasing the lifespan to improve the embodied carbon
efficiency, we can also get more out of the HPC hardware while we have
it.</p>
<p>At a service/system level this often corresponds to maximising the
usage of the service - it’s better to have 100% utilisation than 20%
utilisation because of the cost of embodied carbon (and also because of
the fact that even idle components in HPC systems consume some
electricity).</p>
<p>For individual users and groups on HPC systems, improving the carbon
efficiency with respect to embodied carbon typically corresponds to
increasing the performance of their use of the system so you get more
output per unit of time. Of course, increasing the performance of your
use may lead to higher power draw and higher electricity use increasing
the emissions from the use of electricity. This means that you need to
know what the balance between embodied emissions and emissions from
electricity use are for the HPC system you are using to make useful
choices about improving your carbon efficiency. There are three
potential scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Embodied carbon dominates:</strong> run as high performance
as possible irrespective of electricity use to maximise carbon
efficiency</li>
<li>
<strong>Embodied carbon and carbon from electricity use are evenly
balanced:</strong> you need to find a balance of performance and energy
efficiency to maximise carbon efficiency</li>
<li>
<strong>Carbon from electricity use dominates:</strong> run in as
energy efficient manner as possible to maximise carbon efficiency</li>

<p>The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol is the most commonly-used method
for organisations to measure their total carbon emissions. Understanding
GHG scopes and how to measure your software against industry standards
will help you see to what extent you are reducing carbon emissions and
how that fits with wider activities to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>To complement the GHG protocol, and if yo develop software that is
used by others, you can also use the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)
specification. While the GHG is a more generic measurement suitable for
all types of organisations, the SCI is specifically for measuring a rate
of software emissions and designed to incentivise the elimination of
those emissions.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-ghg-protocol">The GHG protocol<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-ghg-protocol"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org" class="external-link">Greenhouse Gas protocol</a> is
the most widely used and internationally recognized greenhouse gas
accounting standard. <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us" class="external-link">92%</a>
of Fortune 500 companies use the GHG protocol when calculating and
disclosing their carbon emissions and it provides the basis of emissions
reporting for most countries (including the UK). Using the GHG protocol
allows us to compare our emissions from use of HPC systems to other
sources of emissions in a quantitative way.</p>
<p>The GHG protocol divides emissions into three scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Scope 1</strong>: Direct emissions from
<strong>operations</strong> owned or controlled by the reporting
organisation, such as on-site fuel combustion or fleet vehicles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scope 2</strong>: Indirect emissions related to
<strong>emission generation of purchased energy</strong>, such as heat
and electricity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scope 3</strong>: Other indirect emissions from all the
other activities you are engaged in. Scope 3 emissions are typically
split into two further categories: <em>Upstream Emissions</em> and
<em>Downstream Emissions</em>:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Upstream Scope 3 Emissions</strong>: Includes all emissions
from an organisation’s supply chain, e.g. emissions from manufacturing
and shipping a product</li>
<li>
<strong>Downstream Scope 3 Emissions</strong>: Emissions resulting
from the use of a product, e.g. the electricity customers may consume
when using your product or waste output from the product</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scope 3, sometimes referred to as value chain emissions, is the most
significant source of emissions and the most complex to calculate for
many organisations. These encompass the full range of activities needed
to create a product or service, from conception to distribution. In the
case of a laptop, for example, every raw material used in its production
emits carbon when being extracted and processed (part of the upstream
scope 3 emissions). Value chain emissions also include emissions from
the use of the laptop, meaning the emissions from the energy used to
power the laptop after it has been sold to a customer (part of
downstream scope 3 emissions).</p>
<p>Through this approach, it’s possible to sum up all the GHG emissions
from every organization and person in the world and reach a global
total.</p>

falls into Downstream Scope 3 emissions but for operators and users of
the HPC system they would classified as Scope 2 emissions. As we are
approaching this subject as users of HPC systems we will always classify
the emissions from our electricity use on HPC systems as Scope 2.</p>
<p>In short, Downstream Scope 3 emissions are not usually relevant for
use of HPC systems as this part of the emissions is reported in the

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Quantifying the emissions from your work (and generating an emissions
rate, as described below) are critical steps on the path to reducing and
potentially eliminating emissions from your use of HPC systems. The
formula for calculating your emissions from use of HPC systems
(<code>HPC-E</code>) is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">HPC</span><span class="op">-</span><span class="va">E</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="va">E</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="va">I</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="va">M</span></span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>E</code> = Energy consumed by HPC use (in kWh)</li>
<li>
<code>I</code> = Location-based marginal carbon intensity (in
kgCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh)</li>
<li>
<code>M</code> = Embodied emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>You can calculate this on a per job basis or for a larger grouping of
HPC use - even for a full lifetime of an HPC service.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>While it can be tempting to only include the use of HPC that produced
useful output in our emissions calculations this should be avoided. The
true amount of emissions includes <strong>all</strong> of our HPC system
use to get us to the results we use and so failed jobs (due to errors)
or calculations that did not produce useful output must be included. On
the positive side, one of the ways we can reduce our emissions from use
of HPC systems is to be more careful and eliminate emissions arising
from these types of non-productive jobs.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Instead of bucketing the carbon emissions of HPC use into scopes 1-3,
it buckets them into <strong>operational emissions</strong> (carbon
emissions from the electricity required for your HPC use, represented by
<code>E * I</code>) and <strong>embodied emissions</strong> (carbon
emissions from the physical HPC system components, represented by
<code>M</code>).</p>

<p>Many HPC systems now provide energy use data for jobs run on the
system. If this is the case, you can use these as the starting point for
calculating your energy use of HPC resources. If this is not available,
then you may need to estimate the energy use of your use of resources
from component power draw. Even if you have energy use data available
this may only cover energy use of compute nodes (or even processors on
compute nodes) so you do typically have to do some estimation of power
draw of other components to know how much extra energy to add on to
include them in your calculation.</p>
<p>If you are really lucky, the HPC system staff will have done this
calculation for you. As has been done for the UK National Supercomputing
Service, ARCHER2: <a href="https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/energy/#scope-2-emissions" class="external-link">Estimating

<p>The methodologies outlined below all assume the compute nodes are

<h4 id="a--using-total-power-draw">a. Using total power draw<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a--using-total-power-draw"></a>
</h4>
<p>One of the simplest ways to estimate your energy use is to use the
total power draw of the HPC system and divide it by the number of
components to get a mean power draw per component that can be used to
estimate energy use. For example, if the total power draw of the system
is 250 kW and it contains 512 GPU, then the mean power draw per GPU is
<code>250 kW / 512 GPU = 0.488 kW/GPU</code>. This, in turn, means the
energy used for 12 hours use of 2 GPU is
<code>12 hours * 2 GPU * 0.488 kW/GPU = 11.7 kWh</code>.</p>
<p>You should use the component that you measure resource use in to
compute the mean power draw. For example. if your usage is measured in
GPUh, then compute the power draw per GPU; if your usage is measured in
nodeh, compute the power draw per node.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="b--using-per-component-power-draws">b. Using per-component power draws<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#b--using-per-component-power-draws"></a>
</h4>
<p>This approach requires more detailed information being available on
the power draw of different components though measurement or from
information from the vendors of the components. If you are getting your
energy use from counters on the compute nodes (as is sometimes possible
on HPC systems) then this approach allows you to estimate additional
energy overheads that need to be added on in addition to the measured
power draw.</p>
<p>We illustrate this approach using the estimates for the ARCHER2 HPC
system:</p>

</table>
<p>In this case, we have a mix of data measured on the system (power
draw of the compute nodes and power draw of the interconnect switches)
and estimates from the vendor (storage systems and CDU). Here, the total
power draw is estimated at 2,808 kW, there are 5,860 compute nodes and
the unit of resource is nodeh so we can calculate the mean per node
power draw (including all the components in the table) in the same way
as we did for method (a) with
<code>2,808 kW / 5,860 nodes = 0.480 kW/node</code> and use this to
compute energy consumption based on how many nodeh we use.</p>
<p>However, on ARCHER2 we also have the total compute node energy use
available per job to users from the Slurm scheduler. The table above
shows that the compute nodes contribute around 85% of the total power
draw of ARCHER2 (of the components included) so an alternative method to
compute the energy use is to use the measurement from the scheduler and
add an additional 15% to cover the energy used by other components. This
is, in fact, the methodology used for computing per job energy use on
ARCHER2.</p>

<h4 id="add-in-energy-from-plant-overheads">Add in energy from plant overheads<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#add-in-energy-from-plant-overheads"></a>
</h4>
<p>As well as the energy used by the system itself, there is also the
energy used by the plant that supplies power and cooling to the HPC
system. Different data centres have different sizes of overheads and
this is given by PUE (Power Use Efficiency). For example, a PUE of 1.25
indicates that an additional 25% energy use is added on top of the
system energy use to account for the plant.</p>
<p>The PUE will vary with outside weather conditions at the data centre.
For the ARCHER2 example, PUE is typically less than 10% so, s a
conservative estimate, they add an additional 10% energy use to the
total to account for plant overheads.</p>
<p>So, for the ARCHER2 example, the process for computing your total
energy use becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure total energy use from all jobs run</li>
<li>Add 15% extra energy to cover energy use from other components</li>
<li>Add another 10% energy use top of this new total to cover plant
overheads</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have your energy use then you need to convert this to
emissions using the carbon intensity for the electricity supply for the
HPC system. In most cases, HPC systems are powered by the energy grid
and many energy grids provide details on the carbon intensity as a
function of time.</p>
<p>As we saw earlier, for the UK, the carbon intensity is dependent on
location and time. You can access the values through different web
services but one that is commonly used is the <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk" class="external-link">Carbon Intensity API</a>. Carbon
intensity is reported for every region every 30 minute interval. To
estimate your emissions you can either use the fine grained intensity
matched to the run times of your HPC system use or use an aggregate
value over a longer period. The aggregate value is a simpler choice for
a first estimate. The table below shows the approximate average carbon
intensities for the different regions of the UK national grid for 2024

<p>Calculating the embodied emissions can be more difficult than the
operational emissions from energy consumption as it can be more
difficult to get information on embodied emissions associated with HPC
hardware. You may, of course, be lucky and the HPC system you are using
could already provide estimates of the embodied emissions which you can
use!</p>
<p>If you need to estimate this yourself, the major contributors to
embodied emissions are likely to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute nodes</li>
<li>Interconnect switches</li>
<li>Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>so these are the best place to start. Bear in mind that each HPC
system is different so other components may need to be taken into
account. As a rule of thumb, you should look at the HPC system to see
which components there are lots of and use that as the starting place.
Complex components (such as nodes, storage and switches) are likely to
have much higher embodied emissions than simpler components (pumps,
fans, cables etc.).</p>

<p>Note that there is a large amount of uncertainty for Scope 3
emissions due to lack of high quality embodied emissions data. The
number used for the compute node emissions is at the high end of
estimated values for a CPU-only compute node and the actual value could
be as much as 15% lower at around 900 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/node. If the
lower value is used, it reduces the overall estimated embodied emissions
but does not significantly change the fraction of emissions attributed
to the compute nodes.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The definition, application and calculation of the HPC-CI is heavily
inspired by the <a href="https://sci.greensoftware.foundation/" class="external-link">Software
Carbon Intensity (SCI)</a> from the Green Software Foundation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We now describe a methodology (the HPC Carbon Intensity
specification, HPC-CI) to calculate your emissions from HPC system use
and to encourage action towards eliminating emissions.</p>
<p>It is not a replacement for the GHG protocol, but an additional
metric that helps you understand how your HPC system use can be measured
in terms of carbon emissions so they can make more informed decisions.
While the GHG protocol calculates the <strong>total emissions</strong>,
the HPC-CI is about calculating the <strong>rate of emissions</strong>.
In automotive terms, HPC-CI is more like a miles per gallon measurement
and the GHG protocol is more like the total carbon footprint of a car
manufacturer and all their cars they produce every year.</p>
<p>An important thing to note is that it is not possible to reduce your
HPC-CI rate by purchasing offsets in the form of neutralisations,
compensations, or by offsetting electricity in the form of renewable
energy credits (we will cover this in more detail in the next section of
the workshop). This means that HPC system use that makes no effort
toward reducing emissions but spends money on carbon credits cannot
reduce the associated HPC-CI rate.</p>
<p>Offsets are an essential component of any climate strategy; however,
offsets are not eliminations and therefore are not included in the
HPC-CI metric.</p>
<p>If you make your HPC use more <strong>energy efficient, hardware
efficient</strong>, or <strong>carbon aware</strong>, your HPC-CI rate
will decrease. The only way to reduce your rate is to invest time or
resources into one of those three principles. As such, adopting the
HPC-CI metric for your HPC use, will drive investment into one of the
three pillars of green HPC use.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-hpc-ci-equation">The HPC-CI equation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-hpc-ci-equation"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The equation to calculate an HPC-CI rate is simple and very closely
related to the calculation of total emissions presented above:</p>
<pre><code>HPC-CI = [(E * I) + M] per R</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>E</code> = Energy consumed by HPC use (in kWh)</li>
<li>
<code>I</code> = Location-based marginal carbon intensity (in
kgCO2/kWh)</li>
<li>
<code>M</code> = Embodied emissions</li>
<li>
<code>R</code> = Functional unit (e.g. iterations, simulated time,
calculation cycles, research papers published, cost)</li>
</ul>
<p>This yields an emissions rate in carbon emissions per functional unit
(<code>HPC-E per R</code>), e.g. kgCO2e/iteration.</p>
<p>The steps to calculate your HPC-CI score are the similar as
calculating your emissions described above with additional steps to
produce the rate. Steps 1-4 are identical the methodology described
above:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gather your energy use</li>
<li>Determine the carbon intensity at the location of the HPC system you
are using</li>
<li>Determine the embodied emissions associated with your use of
HPC</li>
<li>Compute your total HPC emissions</li>
<li>Select your functional unit (<code>R</code>)</li>
<li>Calculate your HPC-CI rate</li>
</ol>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="select-your-functional-unit-r">5. Select your functional unit (<code>R</code>)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#select-your-functional-unit-r"></a>
</h3>
<p>As we have seen, the HPC-CI is a rate rather than a total and
measures the intensity of emissions according to the chosen functional
unit. The specification currently does not prescribe the functional unit
and you are free to pick whichever best describes the output from your
use of HPC systems. For example, this could be a metric from the
software you use (ns simulated, number of years simulated, iterations)
or a metric tied to research progress (number of compounds modelled,
data points analysed). There may also be ideas in literature related to
your research area of what a good choice may be. You may want to trial
different functional units to see which one works best for your
work.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, imagine that you are simulating the dynamics
of a biomolecular system (using software such as GROMACS, Amber or NAMD)
then you could well chose the number of ns simulated as your functional
unit.</p>
<p>You can use multiple functional units simultaneously to have multiple
HPC-CI values for your use of HPC systems. Different HPC-CI units may be
more or less useful in different contexts.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="calculate-hpc-ci-rate">6. Calculate HPC-CI rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#calculate-hpc-ci-rate"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now you have both the total emisssions for your use of HPC systems
and the number of functional units arising from the same use of HPC
systems you can calculate the HPC-CI by dividing the total emissions by
the total number of functional units.</p>
<p>To continue our example of biomolecular simulation that we mentioned
above, we would take the total emissions from our HPC system use - let
us say this came out to be 1500 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e - and the total number
of functional units - say 950 ns simulated - and combine them:</p>
<pre><code>HPC-CI  = 1500 kgCO2e / 950 ns = 1.58 kgCO2e/ns</code></pre>

<p>In recent years, many economic actors have sought to reach different
climate goals by making various commitments to reducing carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>The terms “net zero”, “carbon neutral”, “carbon negative” and
“climate neutral” have been used interchangeably with the primary
objective to remove, reduce and prevent carbon emissions As interest in
these targets grows, it is essential to have a common understanding of
what they mean and how to achieve them through the strategies and

<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" class="external-link">Science Based Targets
Initiative</a> refers to a mechanism called <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/legacy/2020/09/foundations-for-net-zero-executive-summary.pdf" class="external-link">abatement</a>,
which means eliminating sources of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated
with an organisation’s operations and <a href="https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/education/graduate-study/pgcerts/value-chain-defs" class="external-link">value
chain</a> so that they do not enter the atmosphere. The value chain
describes the full range of activities needed to create a product or
service, from conception to distribution.</p>
<p>Abatement is not enough on its own as there will always be some
emissions that cannot be eliminated due to technological or economic
constraints, but it must form the core of every emissions reduction
strategy.</p>
<p>To balance those residual emissions, we need to look at other
mechanisms such as offsets, compensations or neutralisations.</p>

<h3 id="offsets">Offsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#offsets"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/what-is-a-carbon-offset/" class="external-link">Offsets</a>
are direct investments in emission-reduction projects through the
purchase of carbon credits on the voluntary carbon market (VCM). The VCM
is a decentralised market where private actors voluntarily buy and sell
carbon credits that represent certified removals or reductions of GHGs
from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>To offset emissions, you need to purchase the equivalent volume of
carbon credits to compensate for those emitted, where 1 carbon credit
corresponds to 1 tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed or reduced.</p>
<p>Various positive benefits can stem from these projects, from
ecosystem protection to empowering local communities. However, to ensure
these programs are implemented correctly and have the desired effect on
the environment and the aim to reach world net zero, there are global
standards that they must meet such as Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and
Gold Standard (GS).</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="hpc-ci-and-offsets">HPC-CI and Offsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hpc-ci-and-offsets"></a>
</h4>
<p>There are some limitations to carbon offsets and that is why they are
not considered in an HPC-CI metric. For example, imagine two projects,
both running on a HPC service that is 100% carbon offset and matched
100% by renewable energy. Project A has invested significant time and
resources into making sure it is using resources efficiently, whereas
project B uses resources very inefficiently. For the HPC-CI to be a
helpful metric, project A needs to score better than project B.</p>
<p>If the HPC-CI considered offsets, both projects would score 0. This
would not tell us anything about how efficiently they are using
resources. Although project B is emitting more carbon molecules into the
atmosphere per unit of output, since its score is 0 and the lowest score
is 0, why would it make further investments into improving its carbon
efficiency?</p>
<p>HPC services and users need to have plans for how to both eliminate
as well as neutralise emissions and the HPC-CI helps them to drive the
elimination of emissions due to their use of HPC systems. This makes the
HPC-CI a useful tool to help a research project or HPC service reach net
zero.</p>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.abatable.com/blog/carbon-removal-vs-carbon-avoidance-projects" class="external-link">Neutralisations</a>
are actions that organisations or individuals take to remove carbon from
the atmosphere. Neutralisations refer to the removal and permanent
storage of atmospheric carbon to counterbalance the effect of releasing
CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. This includes actions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Enhancing natural carbon sinks</strong> that remove
CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. For example, forest restoration,
since photosynthesis removes CO<sub>2</sub> naturally. Forest expansion
comes with challenges as it’s essential not to impact the dynamics of
farmland and food supply elsewhere. Modern farming methods can also
prolong the time carbon remains stored in soil.</li>
<li>
<strong>Direct air capture</strong> is the process of capturing
CO<sub>2</sub> from the air and storing it permanently, either
underground or in long-lived products like concrete.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effectiveness of these methods is typically measured based on
whether they can deliver carbon removal at the scale and speed
needed.</p>
<p>When it comes to carbon removal projects, durability is a critical
consideration. The durability of a project describes how long the carbon
dioxide will be kept from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Short-term durability is up to 100 years, medium-term is 100 to 1,000
years, and long-term is more than 1,000 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solutions that rely on Earth’s natural carbon cycle have short-term
durability measured in decades. For example, forestry projects have a
durability of 40 to 100 years.</li>
<li>Engineered solutions such as direct air capture often have long-term
durability measured in millennia. For example, direct air capture has a
durability of 10,000 years.</li>
<li>Long-term projects are typically orders of magnitude more expensive
than short-term projects. Once emitted, carbon remains in the atmosphere
for 5,000 years. To be considered net zero, carbon that has been emitted
needs to be permanently removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A short-term carbon removal project will only remove carbon for 100
years, after which it is back in the atmosphere warming up our planet.
This is one of the reasons why abatement is preferred to neutralisation.
Never releasing carbon is far better than releasing carbon and then
trying to keep it out of the atmosphere for 5,000 years.</p>

<p>There are many different emissions reduction strategies that an
organisation can commit to, from carbon neutral to net zero.
Understanding the different meanings and implications of each one and
finding out which are used by the facilities you use helps you
understand how your use of HPC fits within wider climate goals.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-neutral">Carbon Neutral<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-neutral"></a>
</h3>
<p>To achieve carbon neutrality, an organisation must measure its
emissions, then match the total to its emissions offsets through carbon
reduction projects. This can include carbon removal projects
(neutralisations) and carbon avoidance projects (compensations).</p>
<p>Carbon neutrality is defined by an internationally recognized
standard: <a href="https://info.eco-act.com/hubfs/0%20-%20Downloads/PAS%202060/PAS%202060%20factsheet%20EN.pdf" class="external-link">PAS
2060</a>. Although this does recommend an organisation sets abatement
targets, it does not demand they reduce their emissions. So to be
considered carbon neutral, an organisation can just measure and offset
without investing resources in eliminating their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>To be carbon neutral, you must cover direct emissions (scope 1 and
2). The general expectation is that organisations measure and offset
their scopes 1 and 2, and business travel from scope 3. However, there
is no specific requirement to include that.</p>
<p>Carbon neutral is a significant first step for any organisation since
it encourages measurement. However, there are not enough carbon offsets
in the world to offset the emissions of all the organisations.
Therefore, any strategy that does not include abatement will not scale
or help the world achieve the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Climate
Agreement. This is where net zero comes into play.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="net-zero">Net Zero<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#net-zero"></a>
</h3>
<p>Net zero means reducing emissions according to the latest climate
science and balancing remaining residual emissions through carbon
removals (neutralisations). Net zero, by definition, requires emissions
reductions in line with a 1.5°C pathway. All organisations must do this
to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>The critical differentiator between net zero and carbon neutral is
net zero’s focus on abatement rather than neutralisations and
compensations. A net-zero target aims to eliminate emissions and only to
use offsetting for the residual emissions that you cannot eliminate</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/foundations-for-net-zero-full-paper.pdf" class="external-link">standard
for net zero</a> is being developed by the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" class="external-link">Science Based Targets
initiative</a> (SBTi). They calculate that there is a 66% probability of
limiting global warming to 1.5°C if we reach a level of abatement of
about 90% of all GHG emissions by mid-century. So, to meet a net-zero
target, an organisation needs to eliminate 90% of its emissions by 2050.
The remaining emissions can only be offset using neutralisations and
permanent carbon removals.</p>
<p>A net-zero strategy would mean that the actual amount of carbon in
the atmosphere remains constant.</p>
<p>Also, to be a net-zero target, you must cover direct and indirect,
i.e. supply chain emissions (scopes 1,2 and 3). This is significant
since scope 3 often represents the majority of emissions.</p>
<p>Fo HPC facilities, part of these strategies include educating and
putting policies and approaches in place to support users to understand
and take action to reduce their emissions and maximise the carbon
efficiency of their HPC use.</p>

</h4>
<p>The HPC-CI is a metric specifically designed to drive the elimination
of emissions. The only way to reduce your rate is to invest time and
resources into actions that eliminate emissions. The only activities the
HPC-CI recognises as elimination actions are making your use of HPC
systems more energy-efficient, more hardware efficient, or consuming
lower-carbon energy sources. Offsets are an essential component of any
climate strategy; however, offsets are not eliminations and therefore
are not included in the HPC-CI metric.</p>
<p>Any net-zero strategy needs to have plans for how to both eliminate
as well as neutralise emissions. The HPC-CI helps organisations and
users drive the elimination of emissions due to HPC system use. This
makes the HPC-CI a useful component of any net-zero strategy for
operation and use of HPC systems.</p>

<h3 id="renewable">100% Renewable<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#renewable"></a>
</h3>
<p>When organisations set a target of 100% renewable power, they might
distinguish between being <strong>matched by</strong>
vs. <strong>powered by</strong> renewable energy sources.</p>
<p><strong>Powered by</strong> means you are directly powered by a
renewable power source, say a hydro dam. In that scenario, the energy
the device receives only originates from that source, so you can
confidently say that you are 100% powered by renewables.</p>
<p>For most people, we live on an interconnected grid, with many
producers pumping electricity in and many consumers taking electricity
out. This means the electrons coming into your device are a mixture of
all the electrons going into the grid. For example, suppose the grid
only has 5% of wind supply. You are getting 5% of wind-generated
electrons and 95% fossil fuel-generated electrons.</p>
<p>You cannot track individual electrons. Once the electrons from a wind
farm are on a grid, they all mix with the electrons from a fossil fuel
plant. So there is no way for a consumer to insist the electrons that it
uses only come from renewable sources.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="renewable-energy-certificates-rec">Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#renewable-energy-certificates-rec"></a>
</h4>
<p>To solve this problem, a renewable plant sells two things. The first
is its electricity, which it sells into a grid. The second is a REC, a
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" class="external-link">Renewable
Energy Certificates</a>. 1 REC equals 1 kWh of energy.</p>
<p>If you want to be 100% matched by renewable energy and are on the
grid, the solution is to buy enough RECs to cover the amount of
electricity you consume. For instance, if you consume 100 kWh of
electricity every day, then to be 100% matched by renewables, you buy
100 RECs.</p>
<p>When organizations set 100% renewable targets purchasing RECs on the
market is the solution they often employ to meet their commitments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="ppas">PPAs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ppas"></a>
</h4>
<p>You might also hear the term PPA used alongside RECs. A PPA is a <a href="https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sector/energy/energy-power-agreements/power-purchase-agreements" class="external-link">Power
Purchase Agreement</a>, which is another way to purchase RECs. If you
estimate you need 500 MWh of electricity per year for a particular data
center, you might sign a PPA to purchase 500 MWh per year from a
renewable plant. You would then get all the RECs associated with this
power plant.</p>
<p>PPAs are typically very long-term contracts. A renewable plant can
find financing with one of these agreements since it already has had a
buyer for its electricity for many years.</p>
<p>PPAs encourage something called <strong>additionality</strong>.
Purchasing a PPA drives the creation of new renewable plants. PPAs are a
solution that gets us towards a future where everyone has access to 100%
renewable energy.</p>

<h3 id="hourly-matching">24/7 Hourly Matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hourly-matching"></a>
</h3>
<p>When it comes to 100% renewable claims, the critical question is,
what is the granularity of matching? Do you sum up and net off yearly,
monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly? That question is essential because to
truly transition to renewable energy, we need 100% of the power to come
from low-carbon energy sources like renewables 100% of the time. This
fine granular matching is often called <em><a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/247-hourly-matching-electricity" class="external-link">24/7
hourly matching</a></em>.</p>
<p>24/7 hourly matching is one of the many strategies we need to employ
to help accelerate the transition to a 100% renewable-powered grid. For
example, <a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/" class="external-link">Google</a> and <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/14/made-to-measure-sustainability-commitment-progress-and-updates/" class="external-link">Microsoft</a>
have both committed to 24/7 hourly matching by 2030.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="daily-vs-hourly-matching">Daily vs hourly matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#daily-vs-hourly-matching"></a>
</h4>
<p>Imagine an organization has a demand curve like this, each blue
square represents 1kWh:</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/29_daily_consumption.png" title="Demand curve for electricity use" alt="Demand curve for electricity use" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Demand curve for electricity use</div>
</figure><p>They have purchased RECs from a wind farm that generated electricity
with a curve, so each green square represents 1 REC. Matching by day
means the organization consumed 18 kWh and bought 18 RECs. As a result,
they netted off to zero. So they can say they are <strong>100% matched
by renewable energy daily.</strong></p>
<p>However, if we looked at it in hourly buckets (each square here is 2
hrs in length), then it seems a bit different:</p>
<figure><img src="./fig/30_hourly_match.png" title="Diagram illustrating impact of hourly matching" alt="Diagram illustrating impact of hourly matching" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Diagram illustrating impact of hourly
matching</div>
</figure><p>The total amount of energy consumed is still 18kWh. However, there
are only a few hours in the day where we are 100% matched by renewable
energy for that hour. So for some hours, we have way more renewable
energy than we need. Conversely, we have way less renewable energy than
we require for most hours.</p>
<p>In the above example, they are <strong>100% matched by renewable
energy on an hourly basis for only 6 hrs of the day</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="carbon-free-energy">Carbon-free energy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-free-energy"></a>

<p>The number we use to describe how successful we are at 24/7 hourly
matching is the carbon-free energy percentage.</p>
<p>Carbon-free energy is defined as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon#understanding" class="external-link">the
average percentage of carbon-free energy consumed in a particular
location on an hourly basis</a>.</p>
<p>So for the previous example, if measured using daily matching, we are
100% matched with renewable energy. However, we are only 33.1% matched
if measured using hourly matching. <strong>The CFE percentage is,
therefore, 33.1%</strong>.</p>

</h4>
<p>Carbon aware computing involves responding to electrical carbon
intensity signals and changing the <strong>behavior</strong> of
software, so it emits less carbon. Carbon awareness also helps an
organisation meet their 24/7 hourly matching target and increase its CFE
percentage.</p>
<p>One example of a behavior change is shifting compute to a time when
more renewable energy is available. For example, delaying the start of a
power intensive simulation (or even delaying charging of a laptop) to
when the carbon intensity of electricity is lower, and the supply of
renewable energy is higher.</p>

</h3>
<p>Before we delve into different approaches for different components of
the HPC-CI equation, there is a high level consideration that can reduce
both the <code>E</code> and <code>M</code> terms in the HPC-CI equation
simultaneously:</p>
<p><strong>Ensure any use of HPC is useful</strong> - this sounds
obvious but most HPC users will have had the experience of running jobs
on HPC systems which consume resources but do not produce useful output
due to errors in the software, in the input parameters or even in the
script that runs the job. To improve the HPC-CI rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the jobs you are running will produce useful/significant
output even if they run correctly - do not run calculations/jobs without
a clear understanding of what they add to the research project.</li>
<li>Carefully test input files and job scripts with small/short jobs
before running at large scale to reduce the likelihood of wasted
emissions.</li>
<li>Consider if you can achieve the same project goals with fewer
jobs/calculations. For example, optimise the sampling choices when
exploring parameter spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other strategies for improving the HPC-CI metric and, so, reducing
emissions do depend on whether the dominant component is operational
emissions (i.e. emissions from energy use) or the embodied emissions. If
the components are evenly balanced then you should look at options from
both sections.</p>
<p><strong>Operational emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the energy efficiency of your use - this may involve power
or frequency capping of the hardware you are using. (This improves the
ratio of <code>E</code> to <code>R</code> in the HPC-CI equation.)</li>
<li>Temporal shifting - run when carbon intensity is lower. (Reduces
<code>I</code>.)</li>
<li>Spatial shifting - run on system where carbon intensity is lower,
run on hardware which has better energy efficiency for your use case
(e.g. GPU may be more energy efficient for your use). (Reduces
<code>I</code>, or improves the ratio of <code>E</code> to
<code>R</code>.)</li>
<li>Run fewer calculations/jobs. (Reduces <code>E</code> and
<code>M</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Embodied emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the performance of your use - more output per unit of time
(even at the expense of energy efficiency by removing any power).

<p>For operators of HPC systems and organisations that are procuring HPC
systems, many of the strategies above have equivalents. In all cases,
evaluation of the emissions of the system must be taken into account as
a core part of HPC system procurement and operations. It is also
critical that emissions information is made available to users to allow
them to compute metrics such as the HPC-CI rate to allow them to work to
reduce emissions from their use of HPC systems.</p>
<p><strong>Operational emissions dominate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the energy efficiency of your HPC systems - this may involve
power or frequency capping of the hardware you are providing or
purchasing hardware that is more energy efficient for the system use

<li>Ensure that the power and cooling plant are as efficient as possible
to minimise overheads.</li>
<li>Enable temporal shifting (either automatically or user controlled) -
for example, run workloads with higher power intensities at times when
carbon intensity is lower.</li>
<li>Spatial shifting - site HPC systems in locations that have the
lowest carbon intensities.</li>

<p><strong>Embodied emissions dominate:</strong></p>

<li>Work with users to improve the performance of jobs on the service -
more output per unit of time (even at the expense of energy efficiency
