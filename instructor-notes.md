## Before Teaching This Lesson

TODO: Add notes here...

*You are strongly advised to run through the lesson content prior to teaching
the lesson to ensure that everything works as expected.*

If you experience any issues, please [open an issue][open a lesson issue] in the lesson
repository describing the problem and platform(s) affected. The lesson maintainers will
aim to resolve the issue as soon as possible but we also welcome the opening
of pull requests (linked to issues) that resolve anything that doesn't work as
expected with the lesson content.

## Miscellaneous Tips

- **Timing**: Add notes
- **Reflection Exercise**: At the beginning and end of the workshop, give participants time to
  reflect on what they want to get out of the workshop (at the beginning) and what they
  can apply to their work (at the end). Using the shared notes doc is a great way to
  do this and a good way to make sure that you've addressed specific concerns or goals
  of the participants.

## Learner Profiles and Pathways

In this section we provide some details of example learner profiles and
suggest some possible different pathways or technical focuses to consider
when teaching or planning a lesson based around this Docker material. As such,
the information in this section is not designed to define fixed approaches and
structures for teaching this material. It is instead aimed to provide ideas
and inspiration and to encourage you to think about your audience when
preparing to teach this material. The information here is based on both
discussions about the intended audiences for this material and on direct
experiences of instructors who have taught it at workshops following different
technical pathways.

### Learner profiles

We begin by providing some example learner profiles to highlight the potential
target audience and the types of different research and technical backgrounds
that you may find among learners engaging with this material. With these
profiles, we aim to encourage you to think about the learners attending your
workshop(s) and which episodes it may be most useful to teach.

Considering things from a higher level, we also highlight three core groups of
learners, based on job roles, who you may find attending lessons covering this
material. While recognising that there are likely to be many learners who
don't fit into one of the following groups, or who span more than one of them,
we hope that highlighting these groups helps to provide an example of the
different types of skills and expertise that learners engaging with this
material may have:

- **Researchers:** TODO

- **RSEs:** TODO

- **Systems professionals:** TODO

Beyond this, different pathways offer scope to bring in different episodes
containing different lesson content to support different target audiences or
areas of interest

Some suggested pathways include:

- **High performance computing**
  
  - *Common learner profiles:* Researcher; RSE; Systems professional
